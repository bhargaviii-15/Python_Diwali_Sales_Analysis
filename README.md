# Diwali Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview  
Welcome! This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Diwali sales data using Python. The goal is to analyze sales patterns, customer demographics, regional trends, and derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## 🛠️ Libraries & Tools Used  
- `pandas` — for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation  
- `numpy` — for numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` — for data visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook — for interactive analysis  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
├── Diwali Sales Data.csv ← Original dataset
├── Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb ← Jupyter notebook with the EDA
└── README.md ← This file
## 🔍 Key Insights  
Here are some of the top findings from the analysis:  
- Customer groups with the highest spending and how they compare across categories.  
- Items/categories that dominate sales and how these vary regionally.  
- Seasonal or geographic trends uncovered (for example, certain cities showing stronger sales growth).  
- Suggestions for business strategy based on the data (e.g., stock allocation, targeted promotions).
